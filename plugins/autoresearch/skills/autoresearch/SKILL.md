  Autonomous experiment loop for optimization research. Use when the user wants to:
  - Optimize a metric through systematic experimentation (ML training loss, test speed, bundle size, build time, etc.)
  - Run an automated research loop: try an idea, measure it, keep improvements, revert regressions, repeat
  - Set up autoresearch for any codebase with a measurable optimization target
  Implements the autoresearch pattern with MAD-based confidence scoring, git branch
  isolation, and structured experiment logging. Works in Claude Code and Droid.

# Autoresearch

Autonomous experiment loop: try ideas, keep what works, discard what doesn't, never stop.

**CLI detection**: this skill works in both Claude Code and Droid (Factory CLI). Detect
your runtime: if Droid-specific tools (CronCreate, CreateAutomation) are available or
`$DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set, you are in Droid. Otherwise Claude Code. The loop procedure
is identical in both; only the autonomous-cadence primitive and the helper path differ.

*Adapted from Factory's `autoresearch` plugin (MIT), translated to be Claude-Code-first
and CLI-aware for the Pragmatic Growth marketplace.*

## Overview

You are running an autonomous optimization loop. Your job is to systematically improve a measurable metric by making changes, running experiments, and keeping only the improvements. You maintain structured state files so that any session — including a fresh one with no memory — can resume exactly where you left off.

**Running autonomously.** This loop runs *in-session* and resumes across sessions from
its state files — a fresh session with no memory reads them and continues exactly where
the last one stopped. For unattended cadence you don't have to babysit:

- **Claude Code:** let the loop run in one session until the termination condition or
  context limit; for periodic re-entry, wrap the resume in `/loop` —
  e.g. `/loop 15m "resume autoresearch"` — so each fire reads the state files and runs
  more experiments.
- **Droid:** schedule a same-session `CronCreate` on the same interval. Optionally run
  inside a mission (`/enter-mission`) for milestone tracking and multi-session
  validation — helpful, not required; the loop procedure is unchanged either way.

Pick the primitive matching your runtime once at setup; everything below is identical in
both.

## Resolve the helper path

The experiment helper ships with this plugin. Set `$AR` to its path once, trying in
order and stopping at the first that exists:

1. `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/autoresearch/scripts/autoresearch_helper.py`
2. `$DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/autoresearch/scripts/autoresearch_helper.py` (Droid)
3. newest match of `~/.claude/plugins/{cache,marketplaces}/*/autoresearch/*/skills/autoresearch/scripts/autoresearch_helper.py`
4. newest match of `~/.factory/plugins/{cache,marketplaces}/*/autoresearch/*/skills/autoresearch/scripts/autoresearch_helper.py`

```bash
AR=""
for c in \
  "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/autoresearch/scripts/autoresearch_helper.py" \
  "$DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/autoresearch/scripts/autoresearch_helper.py"; do
  [ -n "$c" ] && [ -f "$c" ] && AR="$c" && break
done
if [ -z "$AR" ]; then
  AR=$(ls -t ~/.claude/plugins/{cache,marketplaces}/*/autoresearch/*/skills/autoresearch/scripts/autoresearch_helper.py \
              ~/.factory/plugins/{cache,marketplaces}/*/autoresearch/*/skills/autoresearch/scripts/autoresearch_helper.py \
       2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi
```

Every helper invocation below is `python3 "$AR" …`. (State files — `autoresearch.md`,
`autoresearch.sh`, `autoresearch.jsonl` — live in the **target repo** and are committed
there; only this helper lives in the plugin.)

## Setup

Before the loop starts, you need to establish the experiment.

### Step 1: Gather Information

Ask the user (or infer from context) for:
- **Goal**: What are we optimizing? (e.g., "minimize val_bpb", "reduce test runtime", "shrink bundle size")
- **Command**: What to run (e.g., `uv run train.py`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build && du -sb dist`)
- **Primary metric**: Name, unit, and direction (e.g., `val_bpb`, unitless, lower is better)
- **Files in scope**: Which files may be modified
- **Constraints**: Hard rules (tests must pass, no new deps, etc.)
- **Termination condition**: When to stop. Ask the user — options are:
  - Fixed experiment count (e.g., 20 experiments)
  - Fixed time budget (e.g., 2 hours)
  - Target metric (e.g., val_bpb < 1.0)
  - Run until interrupted (default)

### Step 2: Create Branch and State Files

```bash
git checkout autoresearch/<goal>-<date> 2>/dev/null || git checkout -b autoresearch/<goal>-<date>
```

Read the source files thoroughly. Understand the workload deeply before writing anything.

Create three files:

#### `autoresearch.md`

The living research document. A fresh agent with no context should be able to read this file and run the loop effectively. Invest time making it excellent.

```markdown
# Autoresearch: <goal>

## Objective
<Specific description of what we're optimizing and the workload.>

## Metrics
- **Primary**: <name> (<unit>, lower/higher is better) — the optimization target
- **Secondary**: <name>, <name>, ... — independent tradeoff monitors

## How to Run
`./autoresearch.sh` — outputs `METRIC name=number` lines.

## Files in Scope
<Every file the agent may modify, with a brief note on what it does.>

## Off Limits
<What must NOT be touched.>

## Constraints
<Hard rules: tests must pass, no new deps, etc.>

## Termination
<When to stop: experiment count, time budget, target metric, or run until interrupted.>

## What's Been Tried
<Update this section as experiments accumulate. Note key wins, dead ends,
and architectural insights so the agent doesn't repeat failed approaches.>
```

#### `autoresearch.sh`

Bash script (`set -euo pipefail`) that: pre-checks fast (syntax errors in <1s), runs the benchmark, and outputs structured `METRIC name=value` lines to stdout. Keep the script fast.

For fast, noisy benchmarks (< 5s), run the workload multiple times inside the script and report the median. Slow workloads (ML training, large builds) don't need this.

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Pre-check: syntax validation
python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('train.py').read())" 2>&1 || { echo "SYNTAX ERROR"; exit 1; }

# Run the workload
output=$(uv run train.py 2>&1)

# Extract and output metrics
val_bpb=$(echo "$output" | grep -oP 'val_bpb=\K[0-9.]+' | tail -1)
echo "METRIC val_bpb=$val_bpb"
```

#### `autoresearch.checks.sh` (optional)

Only create this when the user's constraints require correctness validation (e.g., "tests must pass", "types must check"). Bash script (`set -euo pipefail`) for backpressure checks.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
pnpm test --run --reporter=dot 2>&1 | tail -50
pnpm typecheck 2>&1 | grep -i error || true
```

### Step 3: Initialize JSONL and Commit State Files

Initialize the experiment log:

```bash
python3 "$AR" init --jsonl autoresearch.jsonl --name '<goal>' --metric-name '<metric_name>' --direction <lower|higher>
```

Commit all state files:

```bash
git add autoresearch.md autoresearch.sh autoresearch.jsonl
git commit -m "autoresearch: initialize experiment session"
```

### Step 4: Run Baseline

Run the benchmark and record the baseline result:

```bash
bash autoresearch.sh
```

Parse the METRIC lines from the output, then log the baseline as a keep:

```bash
python3 "$AR" log --jsonl autoresearch.jsonl \
  --commit $(git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD) \
  --metric <baseline_value> \
  --status keep \
  --description "baseline" \
  --asi '{"hypothesis": "baseline measurement"}'
```

This is experiment #1 — it establishes the starting point for all future comparisons.

## The Experiment Loop

**LOOP FOREVER.** Never ask "should I continue?" — the user expects autonomous work. Only stop when:
- The termination condition from setup is met
- The user interrupts
- You detect you're running low on context (see Context Management below)

### For Each Experiment:

#### 1. Choose What to Try

Read `autoresearch.md` (especially "What's Been Tried") and `autoresearch.ideas.md` (if it exists) to pick the next hypothesis. Think about what the data tells you. The best ideas come from deep understanding, not random variations.

#### 2. Make Changes

Edit the files in scope. Keep changes focused — one hypothesis per experiment.

#### 3. Run the Experiment

Execute the benchmark:

```bash
timeout 600 bash autoresearch.sh
```

Capture the full output. Parse `METRIC name=value` lines from the output.

If the run crashes or times out, log it as a crash and revert.

If `autoresearch.checks.sh` exists and the benchmark passed, run it:
```bash
timeout 300 bash autoresearch.checks.sh
```
If checks fail, log as `checks_failed` and revert.

#### 4. Evaluate Results

Compare the primary metric against the current best (or baseline if no keeps yet) using the helper script:

```bash
python3 "$AR" evaluate --jsonl autoresearch.jsonl --metric <value> --direction <lower|higher>
```

This outputs whether to keep or discard, the confidence score, and delta from baseline.

Decision rules:
- **Primary metric improved** -> `keep`
- **Primary metric worse or unchanged** -> `discard`
- **Simpler code for equal performance** -> `keep` (removing code for same perf is a win)
- **Ugly complexity for tiny gain** -> probably `discard`
- Secondary metrics rarely affect the keep/discard decision. Only discard a primary improvement if a secondary metric degraded catastrophically.

#### 5. Record Results

**On keep:**

Log to JSONL first (so the entry is included in the commit):
```bash
python3 "$AR" log --jsonl autoresearch.jsonl \
  --commit $(git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD) \
  --metric <value> \
  --status keep \
  --description "<what was tried>" \
  --asi '{"hypothesis": "<what you tried>"}' \
  # --metrics '{"compile_us": <value>, "render_us": <value>}'  # optional secondary metrics
  --direction <lower|higher>
```

Then commit all changes (including the JSONL entry):
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<description>

Result: {\"status\": \"keep\", \"<metric_name>\": <value>}"
```

**On discard/crash/checks_failed:**

Log to JSONL first (before reverting, so the entry is preserved):
```bash
python3 "$AR" log --jsonl autoresearch.jsonl \
  --commit "0000000" \
  --metric <value_or_0> \
  --status <discard|crash|checks_failed> \
  --description "<what was tried>" \
  --asi '{"hypothesis": "<what you tried>", "rollback_reason": "<why it failed>"}' \
  # --metrics '{"compile_us": <value>, "render_us": <value>}'  # optional secondary metrics
  --direction <lower|higher>
```

Then revert changes, backing up state files so `git clean -fd` doesn't destroy them:
```bash
# Backup state files
cp autoresearch.jsonl autoresearch.jsonl.bak 2>/dev/null || true
cp autoresearch.md autoresearch.md.bak 2>/dev/null || true
cp autoresearch.ideas.md autoresearch.ideas.md.bak 2>/dev/null || true

# Revert all changes
git checkout -- .
git clean -fd 2>/dev/null

# Restore state files
cp autoresearch.jsonl.bak autoresearch.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
cp autoresearch.md.bak autoresearch.md 2>/dev/null || true
cp autoresearch.ideas.md.bak autoresearch.ideas.md 2>/dev/null || true
rm -f autoresearch.jsonl.bak autoresearch.md.bak autoresearch.ideas.md.bak
```

#### 6. Update Research Journal

After every few experiments (or after significant findings), update the "What's Been Tried" section in `autoresearch.md`. Include:
- What worked and why
- What didn't work and why
- Dead ends to avoid
- Current best result and how it was achieved

#### 7. Maintain Ideas Backlog

When you discover promising but deferred optimizations, append them as bullet points to `autoresearch.ideas.md`. Don't let good ideas get lost. Prune stale or tried entries.

#### 8. Loop

Go back to step 1.

## State Files Reference

| File | Format | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `autoresearch.jsonl` | JSON Lines | Append-only experiment log. One JSON object per line. |
| `autoresearch.md` | Markdown | Living research document. Objective, what's been tried, current best. |
| `autoresearch.ideas.md` | Markdown | Hypothesis backlog. Bullet points of promising ideas to try. |
| `autoresearch.sh` | Bash | Benchmark script. Outputs `METRIC name=value` lines. |
| `autoresearch.checks.sh` | Bash | Optional correctness checks (tests, types, lint). |

### JSONL Schema

Each line in `autoresearch.jsonl` is either a config header or an experiment result:

Config header (first line, or on re-init):
```json
{"type": "config", "name": "...", "metricName": "...", "metricUnit": "...", "bestDirection": "lower|higher"}
```

Experiment result:
```json
{
  "run": 1,
  "commit": "abc1234",
  "metric": 1.234,
  "metrics": {"compile_us": 4200, "render_us": 9800},
  "status": "keep|discard|crash|checks_failed",
  "description": "what was tried",
  "timestamp": 1711600000000,
  "segment": 0,
  "confidence": 2.1,
  "asi": {"hypothesis": "...", "rollback_reason": "...", "next_action_hint": "..."}
}
```

### ASI (Actionable Side Information)

Always record ASI with every experiment. At minimum: `{"hypothesis": "what you tried"}`. On discard/crash, also include `rollback_reason` and `next_action_hint`. Add any other key/value pairs that capture what you learned — dead ends, surprising findings, error details, bottlenecks.

ASI is the only structured memory that survives reverts. Without it, future iterations waste time re-discovering the same dead ends.

## Confidence Scoring

After 3+ experiments, the helper script computes a confidence score using Median Absolute Deviation (MAD):

| Confidence | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| >= 2.0x | Improvement is likely real |
| 1.0-2.0x | Above noise but marginal |
| < 1.0x | Within noise — consider re-running to confirm |

The score is advisory — it never auto-discards. If confidence is below 1.0x, consider re-running the same experiment to confirm before keeping.

## Context Management

Every session has finite context (Claude Code and Droid alike). To handle this gracefully:

1. **Track experiment count** in the current session. After ~15 experiments, context is getting heavy.
2. **Save state proactively** — all state lives in files (jsonl, md), so a new session can resume immediately.
3. **When context is getting exhausted**: update `autoresearch.md` with current findings, commit state files, and stop. The next session reads the files and continues.
4. **On resume**: read `autoresearch.md`, `autoresearch.jsonl`, and `git log --oneline -20` to understand where things stand. Check current status:
```bash
python3 "$AR" status --jsonl autoresearch.jsonl
```

## Loop Rules Summary

- **LOOP FOREVER.** Never ask "should I continue?"
- **Primary metric is king.** Improved -> keep. Worse/equal -> discard.
- **Annotate every run with ASI.** Record what you learned, not just what you did.
- **Watch the confidence score.** < 1.0x means within noise — re-run to confirm.
- **Simpler is better.** Removing code for equal perf = keep.
- **Don't thrash.** Repeatedly reverting the same idea? Try something structurally different.
- **Crashes:** fix if trivial, otherwise log and move on.
- **Think longer when stuck.** Re-read source files, study the data, reason about what's actually happening. The best ideas come from deep understanding.
- **Resuming:** read autoresearch.md + git log, continue looping.

## Finalization

When the experiment loop ends (termination condition met, user interrupts, or context exhausted), finalize the results into clean, reviewable branches. This is the last phase of an autoresearch session.

### Step 1: Summarize Results

```bash
python3 "$AR" summary --jsonl autoresearch.jsonl
```

Detect the base branch and review the git log for actual commits:

```bash
base=$(git symbolic-ref --quiet --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's#^origin/##')
base=${base:-main}
merge_base=$(git merge-base HEAD "$base")
git log --oneline --stat "$merge_base"..HEAD
```

### Step 2: Group Changes

Group kept experiments into **logical changesets**. Each group should:
- Represent a single coherent optimization or change
- Not share modified files with other groups (so branches can merge independently)
- Have a clear description of what it achieves and the metric improvement

Present the proposed grouping to the user for approval:

```
Group 1: "Reduce model depth from 8 to 6"
  Files: train.py (DEPTH, HEAD_DIM, N_EMBED)
  Metric improvement: val_bpb 1.15 -> 1.08 (-6.1%)
  Experiments: #3, #7, #12

Group 2: "Switch to cosine LR schedule"
  Files: train.py (lr_schedule, warmup_steps)
  Metric improvement: val_bpb 1.08 -> 1.05 (-2.8%)
  Experiments: #15, #18
```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding. In unattended / worker mode, proceed with the best grouping without waiting for confirmation.

### Step 3: Resolve File Conflicts

If groups share files, resolve before creating branches:
- Merge the groups into one (if changes are related)
- Split the file changes more carefully (if they're truly independent modifications to different parts)
- Ask the user which group gets priority

Groups **must not share files** — each branch must be independently mergeable. If all changes touch the same file and can't be separated, create a single finalized branch with all improvements combined.

### Step 4: Create Clean Branches

For each group (reuse the `$base` / `$merge_base` detected in Step 1):

```bash
git checkout -b autoresearch/finalize/<group-name> "$merge_base"
git checkout autoresearch/<session-branch> -- <file1> <file2> ...
git commit -m "<group description>

Autoresearch results:
- Metric: <name> improved from <baseline> to <best> (<delta>%)
- Confidence: <score>x noise floor
- Experiments: <count> total, <kept> kept"
```

### Step 5: Verify and Report

For each finalized branch, run the benchmark to confirm the improvement holds, run any checks if applicable, and verify it merges cleanly with `$base`.

Present a summary to the user:

```
Created 2 clean branches from 20 experiments:

  autoresearch/finalize/reduce-depth
    val_bpb: 1.15 -> 1.08 (-6.1%)
    Ready for review

  autoresearch/finalize/cosine-schedule
    val_bpb: 1.08 -> 1.05 (-2.8%)
    Ready for review

Original experiment branch preserved: autoresearch/<session-branch>
```

The original experiment branch is always preserved — finalization creates new branches.

## Unattended / worker mode

When the goal, termination condition, files in scope, and constraints are supplied up
front — a Droid mission feature description, a `/loop` prompt, or a cron spec — read them
carefully, follow the same loop procedure above, and respect the termination condition.
When the condition is met, run finalization and report results in the handoff. In Droid
mission-worker mode specifically, proceed with the best grouping in Finalization without
waiting for user confirmation.
