# Changelog

All notable changes to the **pragmatic-growth** marketplace in this repo are
recorded here. The primary release version matches the `flywheel` plugin's
`version` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; each is tagged in git
(`vX.Y.Z`) and linked to its release commit on GitHub.

This file is the canonical, git-tracked source of truth for the version
history. (The public site at <https://plugin.pragmaticgrowth.com> no longer
carries a changelog section — this file is the single source.)

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [4.9.0] — 2026-07-07

**Minor: dispatch's local gate now verifies review evidence** — closing the
one gap a transcript-forensics audit of every real dispatch run found. The
Jul-1 brief hardening took implementer nesting from 0/7 to ~100%, but
compliance stayed prompt-enforced: one audited goal ran its explores, skipped
its review lenses, and still gate-PASSED. The gate now checks, and self-heals.

- **dispatch:** the implementer's Finish report must end with a labeled
  `Fresh-check:` block — the lens verdicts when the fresh-window panel
  applied, or the literal `Fresh-check: not required (one-file mechanical
  edit)` line when it didn't. Working-a-goal step 3 opens with a
  review-evidence check before the gate commands: a missing block, or a
  not-required claim on plainly multi-file work, makes the orchestrator spawn
  the 2–3 read-only lenses itself over `gate_base..HEAD` (fresh windows,
  concurrent; findings are hypotheses to verify). Verified Critical/Important
  findings enter the existing `FAIL_FIXABLE` repair path; the miss itself
  never blocks a goal. Recurring misses surface once via Hygiene's
  lesson-encoding rule (session memory only — no persisted counter, per
  status-only-in-index). Dry-run tested on 7 scenarios with cited answers;
  all flagged ambiguities closed before shipping. Skill change:
  [`210703b`](https://github.com/pragmaticgrowth/flywheel/commit/210703b).

## [4.8.0] — 2026-07-07

**Minor: alignment pass with Anthropic's official loops guidance** — the
"Getting started with loops" article (Claude Devs, 2026-07-06) and the current
`/goal` / scheduled-tasks / routines / workflows / agent-teams docs pages. The
official taxonomy and token guidance map cleanly onto the v4 model (no
architectural changes); this release closes the drift a docs-vs-skills diff
found. Scenario-tested before/after: a baseline subagent run documented the
gaps, a fresh run with citations confirmed the fixes, and every flagged
ambiguity was closed.

- **define-goal:** the emitted Goal contract now ends with a mandatory turn cap
  (`Stop after <N> turns`, sized S≈10 / M≈20 / L≈30) — official guidance bounds
  every `/goal` with a turn or time clause. Enforcement is per-destination
  (run-now: the evaluator; queue: implementer self-enforced, backed by
  dispatch's brakes), and a cap-out reports as a budget stop ("turn cap
  reached"), distinct from a GOAL_UNREACHABLE contract defect. "Goal command
  facts" now documents the evaluator precisely (the configured small-fast
  model, default Haiku), the `/goal` no-argument status readout (turns, token
  spend, latest evaluator reason), and availability (`/goal` is a
  session-scoped Stop hook — needs a trusted workspace with hooks enabled;
  `disableAllHooks` blocks it).
- **loop-architect:** Step 2 maps the official four-loop taxonomy (turn-based /
  goal-based / time-based / proactive) onto the primitive table — a "proactive
  loop" ask routes to the queue/routine rows, not just channels; workflows,
  agent teams, and Stop hooks are called out as building blocks, not loop
  types — and adds an agent-teams row (collaborating peers that message each
  other; never a factory lane). Evaluator naming fixed ("Haiku evaluator" →
  configured small-fast model, default Haiku). New guidance: pair `/goal` with
  auto mode for unattended runs (per-tool vs per-turn prompts); match `/loop`
  intervals to the watched system's change rate (Monitor-tool alternative;
  project `loop.md` beats user); routines management (`/schedule
  list|update|run`, 1-hour minimum cadence, web-only API/GitHub triggers);
  Step 4 names the built-in usage surfaces (`/usage`, `/goal` status,
  `/workflows`); Step 5 adds pilot-on-a-smaller-slice before large workflow
  runs.
- **dispatch:** the parallel-implementer ban now names agent-team teammates
  explicitly (intro + implementer brief); new Hygiene rule **encode recurring
  lessons** — a gate-failure class recurring across goals is a system defect:
  propose (one needs-you line) encoding it into `config.verify` /
  `config.skills` / CLAUDE.md instead of re-fixing per goal; the
  orchestrator-level no-progress rule is marked distinct from the
  implementer's ~3-honest-attempts rule.
- **Site/README:** one-line note that flywheel implements the official
  guidance's "proactive loops" composition. Skills commit:
  [`da15b6a`](https://github.com/pragmaticgrowth/flywheel/commit/da15b6a).

## [4.7.0] — 2026-07-02

**Patch/minor: end-to-end audit of the goal + autonomous-dispatch pipeline —
gate correctness fixes and robustness hardening.** A multi-agent audit (finders
per subsystem + adversarial verification) surfaced 13 verified findings across
`define-goal`, `dispatch`, `pg_validate.py`, `loop-architect`, `factory-doctor`,
and the docs; all confirmed ones are fixed here. No new machinery — the changes
tighten existing checks and remove retired v3 vocabulary.

#### Local gate (`pg_validate.py`) — correctness

- **Fixed a false PASS on unproven bug fixes.** `already_correct` was a naive
  full-text substring scan of the immutable goal body, so any prose containing
  "already correct" (even negated, "was *not* already correct") flipped a bug
  fix that reproduced nothing into a PASS. It now reads an explicit
  `already_correct: true` frontmatter KEY only.
- **Fixed correct TDD goals being blocked.** `blast_radius` now exempts test
  paths (`tests/`, `__tests__/`, `*_test.go`, `*.test.ts`, …) from the
  out-of-scope check, so a proving test added in a split-tree layout no longer
  trips scope validation when `touches:` names product surfaces. Test paths are
  still bound by the forbidden-path and lockfile checks.
- **Retired dead v3 checks.** `one_goal_integrity` (which asserted `goal/<id>`
  branch names, PR-body markers, and PR base — all removed in v4.0.0) is replaced
  by `queue_untouched`, the one check meaningful on a local diff. Removes the
  synthesized fake-PR inputs and misleading vocabulary a maintainer could mistake
  for "dispatch still opens PRs".

#### Dispatch — robustness

- **Cross-fire transient-death brake.** The `~3 respawns per session` cap reset
  every `/loop` fire; a chronically-dying goal could livelock forever. Added a
  session-independent age brake (claim-commit age vs loop cadence) that blocks
  `repeated transient death` — no new persisted counter.
- **Single-`in_progress` data-loss guard.** Phase 1 now stops (surfaces
  needs-you) if it finds more than one `in_progress` claim, instead of
  `git reset --hard`-ing an older claim's `gate_base` and silently rewinding a
  newer claim's committed work on the linear branch.
- **Report reconciliation.** A residual `in_progress` entry now counts into
  `blocked` so `done + ready + blocked` always equals `total`.

#### define-goal, loop-architect, factory-doctor, docs

- **define-goal:** ID reservation is now LOCAL (push optional/backup-only) to
  match the v4 claim model — no longer breaks on repos with no remote;
  documented the `already_correct` frontmatter key; scoped `acceptance:` to the
  headless-runnable subset (dev-server browser checks stay in the human-visible
  criteria, not the gate); noted the gate auto-exempts test paths from `touches:`.
- **loop-architect:** replaced "merged PR" / "merge ledger" health-metric
  vocabulary with the no-PR v4 "gate-passed completed goal" / "completion ledger".
- **factory-doctor:** `working_branch_check` had inverted semantics — it WARNed
  on the healthy state (on `config.base`) and stayed silent on the dangerous one.
  Now WARNs when off an explicit `config.base` (mirroring dispatch's hard-STOP),
  INFO when on it; status-line token `⚠ on-base` → `⚠ off-base`.
- **Test hygiene:** the stale `test_public_docs_advertise_two_plugins` root test
  (asserted "two plugin" while the repo ships four) now derives the expected
  count from the marketplace manifest so it self-updates; README documents the
  gate's `INCONCLUSIVE` verdict (setup gap → `/factory-doctor`).

## [4.6.0] — 2026-07-01

**Minor: two new marketplace plugins — `autoresearch` 1.0.0 and `human-writing`
1.0.0**, bringing the `pragmatic-growth` marketplace to four plugins alongside
`flywheel` and `html-artifacts`. Both are adapted from Factory plugins and
translated to be Claude-Code-first while staying CLI-aware, matching the
conventions of the existing plugins.

#### `autoresearch` 1.0.0 — autonomous optimization loop

- **What it does.** Given a measurable metric, a benchmark command, files in
  scope, constraints, and a termination condition, it works an
  `autoresearch/<goal>-<date>` branch: try one hypothesis → run the benchmark →
  keep the change if the primary metric improves and `git`-revert it if not →
  journal what was learned (ASI) → repeat. **MAD-based confidence scoring**
  separates real gains from benchmark noise. On termination it groups the kept
  experiments into independently-mergeable branches for review; the raw
  experiment branch is always preserved.
- **File-based, resumable.** All state lives in the target repo
  (`autoresearch.md` living doc, `autoresearch.sh` benchmark emitting
  `METRIC name=value`, append-only `autoresearch.jsonl`, optional `.checks.sh` /
  `.ideas.md`), so a fresh session with no memory reads them and continues
  exactly where the last one stopped. Ships one stdlib-only helper,
  `scripts/autoresearch_helper.py` (`init`/`log`/`evaluate`/`summary`/`status`).
- **Translated to Claude Code, still CLI-aware.** `.claude-plugin` manifest; the
  helper is resolved via `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`/`$DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT` with a
  cache-glob fallback (the house convention) instead of the source's
  cwd-relative call; the Factory mission-mode spine is replaced with `/loop`
  (Claude Code) or same-session `CronCreate` (Droid) for unattended cadence,
  with an optional Droid-mission note; finalization detects the repo's default
  branch instead of hardcoding `main`; context wording is session-neutral. A
  dry-run review then hardened the port: robust base-branch resolution with a
  guard, and clean `log` snippets (the upstream's mid-command `# --metrics`
  comment had orphaned the trailing `--direction`).
- Adapted from Factory's `autoresearch` plugin (MIT).

#### `human-writing` 1.0.0 — AI-writing cleanup

- **What it does.** Edits AI-sounding text into human prose: scans for the tells
  catalogued in Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" — inflated significance,
  promotional language, `-ing` filler, em-dash and rule-of-three overuse, AI
  vocabulary, vague attributions, and chatbot artifacts ("I hope this helps!") —
  rewrites them, and pushes for real voice instead of clean-but-soulless prose.
- **CLI-neutral, minimal port.** Pure writing guidance — one `SKILL.md`, no
  scripts, state, or references — so it needed no runtime translation beyond
  house frontmatter (`name` + `description`, dropped the upstream `version:`) and
  attribution. Extracted from Factory's multi-skill `droid-evolved` plugin as a
  standalone single-skill plugin. Content based on Wikipedia's guide (WikiProject
  AI Cleanup, CC BY-SA).

#### Marketplace

- **Install.** `/plugin install autoresearch@pragmatic-growth` and
  `/plugin install human-writing@pragmatic-growth` (Claude Code), or the
  `@flywheel` equivalents (Droid). `marketplace.json`, `README.md`, the public
  site, and `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` all updated to list four plugins. Release
  commit: [`557b933`](https://github.com/pragmaticgrowth/flywheel/commit/557b933).

## [4.5.0] — 2026-07-01

**Minor: factory-doctor detects and strips deprecated v3 config keys, and
recon's per-run model override is made CLI-aware.** Closes a real gap found on a
project that was set up under the v3 model, updated to the v4 plugin, and kept
running an `index.yaml` full of dead config.

- **`config-drift` check + auto-strip (factory-doctor).** A queue set up under
  v3 still carries `merge` / `wip` / `execution` / `autonomy` — keys the v4
  one-goal/local-gate model removed and that v4 dispatch now **silently ignores**,
  so the owner keeps thinking in the old PR/worktree/herdr model. The read-only
  probe (`doctor_checks.py`) gains a `config-drift` check (new
  `DEPRECATED_V3_KEYS` constant + `config_drift_check` helper, unit-tested) that
  WARNs naming exactly which dead keys are present; factory-doctor then
  **auto-strips only those keys** from `index.yaml` config in one atomic edit,
  preserving every live key (`base`/`model`/`skills`/`verify`/`budget`), comments,
  and all `goals:` entries, echoing each removed `key=value` under `fixed:`. The
  removed-key set is one constant so future removals extend one list.
- **Recon model override made CLI-aware (define-goal).** Recon still inherits the
  session/runtime model by default and there is deliberately **no**
  `config.research_model` knob (it would need per-CLI translation and re-invites
  the shallow-recon failure the rule guards against). The one override — a per-run
  user ask — is now documented as CLI-aware: in Claude Code it's an Anthropic-only
  alias (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`/`inherit`); in Droid it's a concrete full model
  ID via `droid exec -m <id>` (no `sonnet`-style short alias exists there, and
  headless accepts only built-in IDs). Model-ID strings are treated as
  version-dependent; the stable fact is the format.
- **Docs aligned.** CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md, README, and the site version reflect the
  new factory-doctor auto-fix. Source change:
  [`11006c0`](https://github.com/pragmaticgrowth/flywheel/commit/11006c0).

## [4.4.0] — 2026-07-01

**Minor: dispatch's intra-goal quality loop gets a multi-lens fresh check and
named subagent patterns.** No change to the sequential, one-goal-per-run,
worktree-free dispatch model — this sharpens the per-goal quality loop and
documents why the model is shaped the way it is.

- **Multi-lens fresh check.** The implementer's post-implementation review
  (quality-loop step 5) upgrades from a single verifier/reviewer subagent to a
  small panel of independent read-only lenses run concurrently:
  contract-conformance, tests + overbuild, and stray-files + regressions. Two or
  three lenses is the norm and stays lightweight; it escalates to a read-only
  review Workflow only at the ~5+ independent-checks threshold already defined in
  quality-loop step 3. Proportional by design — a one-file mechanical edit skips
  the panel entirely. Source change:
  [`44aa885`](https://github.com/pragmaticgrowth/flywheel/commit/44aa885).
- **Named subagent patterns.** The implementer brief now names
  `subagent-driven-development` as the method behind its nested read-only
  fan-out, and calls out two patterns that fit inside one goal: adversarial
  verification (a reviewer tries to refute the change, not rubber-stamp it) and
  loop-until-dry for bug hunts. All graceful — "invoke the skill when it is
  available," with the run-it-yourself fallback intact when subagents aren't
  provided.
- **The sequential model documented as deliberate scar tissue.** The dispatch
  header now states outright that the single-branch, worktree-free, no-parallel
  shape is a deliberate choice with the v3 livelock behind it (see 4.0.0), so
  worktrees and cross-goal parallelism are not re-proposed as "missing." The
  extra concurrency lives INSIDE one goal (read-only recon/review), never across
  goals.
- **Docs aligned.** README's per-goal description reflects the multi-lens fresh
  check; the public site and README version text advertise v4.4.0.

## [4.3.0] — 2026-06-30

**Minor: HTML artifacts split into their own marketplace plugin.** This release
keeps `html-artifacts` in the same GitHub repository and `pragmatic-growth`
marketplace, but publishes it as a separate installable plugin.

- **Two-plugin marketplace.** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` now lists both
  `flywheel` and `html-artifacts`; the new plugin is sourced from
  `./plugins/html-artifacts`.
- **Flywheel refocused.** The root `flywheel` plugin now contains the four
  workflow skills only: `define-goal`, `dispatch`, `loop-architect`, and
  `factory-doctor`.
- **HTML artifacts preserved.** The existing `html-artifacts` skill and its
  progressive-disclosure references moved intact under
  `plugins/html-artifacts/skills/html-artifacts/`, with its own plugin manifest
  at version 1.0.0.
- **Install docs aligned.** README, CLAUDE/AGENTS, and the public site now show
  the separate install commands: `flywheel@pragmatic-growth` and
  `html-artifacts@pragmatic-growth` for Claude Code, or `flywheel@flywheel` and
  `html-artifacts@flywheel` for Droid. Source change:
  [`d802bbc`](https://github.com/pragmaticgrowth/flywheel/commit/d802bbc5f6517929e3656651b7cd64c9f5bec342).
- **Release metadata aligned.** The root plugin manifest, README version badge,
  and public site version text now advertise v4.3.0.

## [4.2.0] — 2026-06-30

**Minor: HTML artifacts join the marketplace.** This release adds a fifth skill,
`html-artifacts`, for rich browser deliverables when markdown would flatten the work.

- **New `html-artifacts` skill.** Produces self-contained `.html` plans, specs, PR/code
  review writeups, module maps, diagrams, timelines, research explainers, status/incident
  reports, decks, prototypes, and one-off editors with copy/export round trips. Source
  change: [`fff9b12`](https://github.com/pragmaticgrowth/flywheel/commit/fff9b12).
- **Progressive-disclosure references.** The skill keeps a compact trigger/routing
  `SKILL.md`, with separate references for foundation rules, planning/comparison,
  code review, design/prototypes, diagrams/data, reports/research, custom editors,
  decks, and source coverage.
- **Skills-only boundary preserved.** The new skill does not add commands, servers,
  listeners, hooks, MCP surfaces, or a build step; interactive artifacts round-trip via
  in-file copy/export buttons.
- **Docs and coverage aligned.** README, CLAUDE/AGENTS, the public site, and regression
  tests now advertise the five-skill lineup and guard against accidentally adding a
  listener/server surface to `html-artifacts`.
- **Release metadata aligned.** The plugin manifest, marketplace copy, README version
  badge, and public site version text now advertise v4.2.0.

## [4.1.3] — 2026-06-28

**Patch: recon subagents inherit the session model.** This release removes the hard-coded
Sonnet policy for `define-goal` recon and synthesis subagents.

- **Model inheritance for recon.** `define-goal` now tells recon search subagents and the
  optional synthesis/judgment subagent to inherit the current session/runtime model, and not
  set a fixed alias, including Sonnet, unless the user explicitly asks for one in that run.
  Source change:
  [`89ae165`](https://github.com/pragmaticgrowth/flywheel/commit/89ae165).
- **Config scope clarified.** `config.model` remains scoped to spawned code-writing agents,
  while recon and batch-mode finder agents inherit the current model by default. The README,
  public site, and repo agent guide now use the same wording.
- **Regression coverage added.** A docs policy test now fails if active docs reintroduce
  forced-Sonnet recon language or drift in the public config model vocabulary.
- **Release metadata aligned.** The plugin manifest, README version badge, and public site
  version text now advertise v4.1.3.

## [4.1.2] — 2026-06-28

**Patch: versioned agent-guide alignment.** This release packages the
`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` synchronization rule as an explicit versioned update.

- **Cross-runtime guide alignment.** `CLAUDE.md` now says Claude Code must verify
  `AGENTS.md` after guide edits, while Codex or Droid must update `CLAUDE.md`
  when they touch `AGENTS.md`. The repo keeps `AGENTS.md` as a symlink to
  `CLAUDE.md`, and the guideline now says to restore that symlink or update both
  filenames in the same commit if it is ever missing or broken. Source change:
  [`d1f8400`](https://github.com/pragmaticgrowth/flywheel/commit/d1f8400).
- **Release metadata aligned.** The plugin manifest, README version badge, and
  public site version text now advertise v4.1.2.

## [4.1.1] — 2026-06-28

**Patch: brief-first goal intake and Droid install hardening.** This keeps the v4.1
one-goal dispatch model unchanged while removing two autonomy blockers found in review.

- **Brief-first goal and loop intake.** `define-goal` now explicitly extracts the desired
  outcome, target system/environment, validator, scope, risk, and destination before recon,
  asks at most one concise proactive question round when those facts would change the goal,
  and still finishes with a real run-now command or queued goal artifact. `loop-architect`
  now uses the same short intake and returns to `define-goal` when a recurring factory run
  needs an actual goal contract.
- **Droid install path aligned with current Factory docs and the local CLI.** README and the
  public site use the tested GitHub marketplace add + `flywheel@flywheel` install flow,
  include `droid plugin marketplace list` so users can confirm Factory's registered
  marketplace name, and include a Droid headless `/factory-doctor` preflight command.
  `CLAUDE.md` no longer recommends invalid `droid plugin marketplace add ./` validation.
- **Factory Doctor path resolution hardened.** The skill resolves `$DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT`
  directly before falling back to the Factory plugin cache, instead of relying on an
  undocumented `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` alias in Droid.
- **Marketplace copy aligned.** The marketplace description now says Flywheel works one
  ready goal per run on the current branch, not isolated implementer lanes.

## [4.1.0] — 2026-06-28

**One-goal dispatch with a lightweight subagent-driven quality loop.** `dispatch` now works
at most one ready goal per run, then reports and stops. Long unattended runs still drain the
queue by repeating the same safe cycle with `/loop /dispatch` (Claude Code) or a
same-session Droid cron. This keeps the v4 direct-to-branch model simple while making each
fire easier to reason about and recover.

- **One ready goal per `/dispatch` run.** The current branch remains the integration surface:
  no PRs, no worktrees, no `goal/<id>` branches, and no parallel code-writing lanes. PASS
  still squashes to one `feat(goal NNN)` commit and completes the goal; FAIL still rolls back
  to `gate_base` and blocks with a reason.
- **Latest-context preflight.** Before spawning the implementer, `dispatch` now gathers a
  short read-only summary of the newest plan/progress note and any current/latest PR context
  available through `gh`. That context is advisory only: it never creates a merge gate,
  authorizes a branch switch, or overrides the goal contract/local gate.
- **Subagent-driven discipline without the old orchestration machinery.** The single
  foreground implementer must use a short plan/checklist, TDD for code changes, and a fresh
  verifier/reviewer subagent for non-trivial work. Workflow/mission mode is allowed only for
  bounded read-only fan-out or review inside that one goal, never for parallel
  implementation or cross-run state.
- **Docs aligned.** `define-goal`, `loop-architect`, `CLAUDE.md`, README, and the public site
  now describe one-goal dispatch, TDD-backed checks, and repeated `/loop /dispatch` as the
  queue-drain mechanism.

## [4.0.1] — 2026-06-28

**Patch: harden the bug repro-direction gate against a false PASS.** The local gate ran a
`type: bug` goal's `acceptance:` command in a *fresh* base `git worktree` that lacks installed
deps (`node_modules`/`.venv` are gitignored), so a test-runner command (`npm test`/`pytest`)
could go red on base for **environment** reasons and be mistaken for a genuine bug
reproduction — a false PASS. Two guards in `pg_validate.py`:

- **Best-effort dep-sharing.** The base worktree now symlinks the live checkout's dependency
  dirs (`node_modules`, `.venv`, `venv`, `vendor`) so the acceptance command runs against base
  product code with a working environment. Cleanup removes only the symlink, never the target.
- **Bare-base control run.** When a separate proving test is overlaid (the TDD case), the gate
  runs the acceptance on the bare base *first*; if base can't run clean before the proving test
  exists, the red is environment/pre-existing noise → **INCONCLUSIVE, never a forged PASS**.
  Direct-probe acceptance (e.g. `grep`, no overlaid test file) is unchanged.

This converts the prior false-PASS path into a safe INCONCLUSIVE → surfaced for a human, in
keeping with the v4 "never silent-PASS" rule. (Caught by the v4.0.0 final review.)

## [4.0.0] — 2026-06-27

**BREAKING — the factory goes sequential and local.** `dispatch` no longer opens
pull requests, creates worktrees, or runs implementers in parallel. It drains the
`docs/goals/` queue one goal at a time, in a single session, committing directly to
the branch you start it on, and keeps each goal only if a **local build+test gate**
passes. This replaces the entire v3 PR → CI → auto-merge model, which livelocked on
real autonomous runs: dozens of PR-shepherding cycles per PR, self-hosted CI runners
going offline and blocking every merge, and piles of stale `goal/*` and
`worktree-agent-*` branches left as garbage. Sequential + local-gated removes that
whole class of failure.

- **`dispatch` is a sequential single-session drain.** Per goal: claim → one
  *foreground* implementer commits its work on the current branch → the orchestrator
  runs the local gate authoritatively → **PASS** squashes the work into one
  `feat(goal NNN)` commit kept on the branch; **FAIL** rolls back to the goal's
  `gate_base` and marks it `blocked`. No PRs, no worktrees, no `goal/<id>` branches,
  no `wip`/parallel agents, no herdr. Two anchors per goal — `anchor` (pre-claim HEAD)
  and `gate_base` (post-claim HEAD, what the gate diffs against, so the claim's queue
  commit isn't in the validated diff).
- **The local gate replaces CI as the merge gate.** `pg_validate.py` was rewritten
  from a GitHub-PR gate (`--pr`) into a local branch-diff gate (`--head/--base`, no
  `gh`): blast-radius, forbidden-content/secret scan, one-goal integrity, and the bug
  repro-direction proof (red-on-base → green-on-head) all run on the local
  `gate_base..HEAD` diff plus the repo's ordered `config.verify` commands. Unresolved
  refs or no runnable gate → `INCONCLUSIVE`, never a silent PASS. CI, if the repo has
  it, is a **non-blocking** post-push observation surfaced under `needs-you`.
- **Config slimmed** to `base`, `model`, `skills`, `verify` (the ordered local
  build+test gate, e.g. `["npm ci", "npm run build", "npm test"]`), and `budget`.
  Removed: `merge`, `wip`, `validation`/`llm_validation`/`validator_model`/
  `validation_attempts`, `execution`, `autonomy`, `state_branch`.
- **Removed machinery:** `pg_safe_merge.py` (the PR merge wrapper), `pm.py` +
  `references/herdr-mode.md` + the herdr-pm vendoring, and `resolve_ids.py` (the herdr
  pane resolver). ~82 KB of code deleted.
- **`factory-doctor`** dropped the PR/CI-world checks (`merge-permission`,
  `branch-protection`, `base-push`, `state-branch`, `validation-gate`) and added
  `verify` (local gate configured & runnable), `working-tree` (clean), and
  `working-branch`. `gh`/`gh-auth`/`ci` are now INFO-only; the only CLI flag is
  `--base`.
- **`define-goal`** goal contracts no longer instruct opening a PR; dropped the
  parallel-`wip` guidance; goals carry `acceptance:`/`verify` for the local gate;
  a criterion that can't be expressed as a command becomes a human-verification item
  surfaced under `needs-you` (the opt-in LLM validator is gone).
- **`loop-architect`** documents `dispatch` as a sequential single-session drain;
  `/loop` is only for picking up later-added goals, not a 15-minute parallel cadence.
- Docs (CLAUDE.md invariants, README, the public site) rewritten to the sequential,
  local-gated, direct-to-branch model.

## [3.0.1] — 2026-06-25

**Validator fix: TDD bug fixes no longer FAIL_CONTRACT just because the proving
test arrives with the fix.** A real `merge: auto` run kept rejecting genuinely-good
bug fixes: the deterministic gate's repro-direction check ran the goal's
`acceptance:` commands on a clean base checkout and demanded one go red, but in
standard TDD the failing test is *added by the fix PR* — so it never exists on
base, nothing can be red there, and every good fix was ruled "fixed nothing"
(FAIL_CONTRACT). The contract couldn't be amended around it either: even adding
the test command to `acceptance:` didn't help, because the test file still isn't
on base.

- **`pg_validate.py` now overlays the PR's changed test files onto the base
  checkout** (`git checkout <head> -- <test-files>`) before running `acceptance:`
  for `type: bug`. A genuine regression test then fails on base product code (bug
  present) and passes on head (bug fixed) — the canonical red→green proof. The
  overlay is monotonic: it only adds tests, never removes the bug, so it can never
  turn a previously-passing validation into a failure.
- Test-file detection (`is_test_path`) spans JS/TS (`.test.`/`.spec.`/`__tests__`),
  Python (`test_*.py`), Go (`_test.go`), Ruby, Java, and `tests/`/`spec/` dirs.
- FAIL_CONTRACT evidence is now specific: "tests overlaid but still green on base"
  (the test doesn't reproduce the bug) vs "no recognizable test file in the diff"
  (the fix ships no regression test) — instead of a single ambiguous "fixed
  nothing".
- **`define-goal`** now requires `type: bug` goals to name a real test-running
  command in `acceptance:` (not just typecheck/lint/build) — the gate needs a
  command that actually executes the regression test, or there is nothing to go
  red. This was the second half of the same real-run failure (a hydration bug
  whose `acceptance:` was only typecheck/lint/build).
- `dispatch`'s Validate step (2b) documents the overlay and the remaining genuine
  contract gap.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-06-24

**Renamed `pg-plugin` → `flywheel`.** A rebrand, not a behavior change — the
factory, the four skills, the `docs/goals` queue design, and the merge gate
are all unchanged. The name now says what it is: a self-sustaining loop that
turns plain-language wants into verified PRs.

- **Plugin name, skill namespace, and install target all change.** Skills are
  now `flywheel:<skill>` (was `pg-plugin:<skill>`), and the plugin installs as
  `flywheel@pragmatic-growth`.
- **The GitHub repo moved to `pragmaticgrowth/flywheel`** (the old
  `pragmaticgrowth/pg-plugin` path redirects, so existing links keep working).
- **Migration:** uninstall the old plugin, refresh the marketplace, and install
  under the new name — Claude Code: `/plugin uninstall pg-plugin` →
  `/plugin marketplace update pragmatic-growth` →
  `/plugin install flywheel@pragmatic-growth` (Droid: the `droid plugin …`
  equivalents). The `docs/goals/` queue in your repos is untouched.
- **Unchanged:** the `pragmatic-growth` marketplace name, and the `pg_*.py`
  helper scripts (`pg_safe_merge.py`, `pg_validate.py`) — there `pg` is the
  publisher, Pragmatic Growth, so existing merge allow-rules keep working.

## [2.10.0] — 2026-06-24

**Loop-engineering hardening** — from a 20-bookmark research audit of the
state-of-the-art "loop engineering" discipline; all 11 roadmap items shipped.

- `config.budget` — an external "burnstop" the orchestrator can't edit:
  `max_spawns_per_session` / `max_iterations` ceilings on cumulative spend
  across a scheduled run. On exhaustion dispatch stops claiming/spawning,
  lets in-flight work drain, surfaces `budget exhausted` under needs-you, and
  fires one notification.
- `GOAL_UNREACHABLE` escape hatch — an implementer can declare a goal
  genuinely unreachable, routing it to a needs-you contract amendment instead
  of respawning forever.
- Cost-per-accepted-change metric (merges ÷ spawns), a per-fire heartbeat for
  silent-death detection, and a drained-queue terminal stop.
- Subjective success criteria route to an independent grader; proof-of-output
  and irreversible-action gates added.
- factory-doctor gains read-only `validation-gate`, `queue-liveness`, and
  `goal-contracts` probes (+12 tests).

## [2.9.7] — 2026-06-24

**Safe base→main promotion.** After a real run auto-deleted the base branch,
promotion now goes through a throwaway `promote-<date>-to-<target>` head
branch so a repo's `delete_branch_on_merge: true` can't delete the persistent
base as a side effect. Audit merge side effects, and protect the base as the
robust repo-side guard.

## [2.9.6] — 2026-06-24

**Protected-main support.** `config.state_branch` (default `= base`) holds the
whole `docs/goals/` queue on a separate unprotected branch, so the factory
never has to push to a protected base — only implementer code PRs target it.
Backward-compatible: default `= base` means zero change for unprotected repos.

## [2.9.5] — 2026-06-24

**Recon-populated contracts.** define-goal auto-fills a goal's `touches:` and
`acceptance:` fields from recon findings instead of leaving them for a human.

## [2.9.4] — 2026-06-24

**LLM semantic validator (Phase 2, opt-in).** With `config.llm_validation: on`,
a single read-only adversarial validator — fed only the contract + raw diff +
checkout, never the worker's narrative — must earn a PASS with replayable
evidence. Runs only after the deterministic gate passes; the deterministic
FAIL always wins.

## [2.9.3] — 2026-06-24

**Deterministic merge gate.** Under `merge: auto`, `pg_validate.py` runs on a
fresh detached checkout before every merge: one-goal integrity, bug
repro-direction (red on base → green on head), fresh-checkout acceptance-green,
blast-radius, and a secret/forbidden-content scan — emitting a SHA-bound
`PASS | FAIL_FIXABLE | FAIL_CONTRACT | INCONCLUSIVE` verdict. The orchestrator
merges; the validator never does.

## [2.9.2] — 2026-06-23

**Progress-first report.** Dispatch's per-iteration report line leads with
`<done>/<total> done` plus a 20-cell fill bar, then labeled
ready / running / blocked counts — never `ready/total`, which reads as
"nothing done".

## [2.9.1] — 2026-06-23

**Scripted browser verification.** define-goal and factory-doctor gain a
scripted browser-verification path for UI work, so acceptance can be proven
against a running page.

## [2.9.0] — 2026-06-23

**Dual-runtime (Claude Code + Droid).** Every skill detects the runtime and
uses the correct paths, commands, and scheduling primitives (`/goal` vs
`droid exec`, `/loop` vs `CronCreate`). factory-doctor now checks settings in
both `.claude/` and `.factory/` paths.

## [2.8.7] — 2026-06-23

Hardened define-goal and dispatch for multi-machine concurrency on the shared
queue.

## [2.8.6] — 2026-06-23

factory-doctor writes a version-durable merge allow-rule (survives plugin
version bumps).

## [2.8.5] — 2026-06-23

factory-doctor's pyyaml auto-fix survives a PEP-668 externally-managed Python.

## [2.8.4] — 2026-06-23

factory-doctor auto-installs the plugin's `pyyaml` dependency.

## [2.8.3] — 2026-06-23

factory-doctor resolves the `pg_safe_merge` wrapper from the plugin install
(not repo-relative), and handles the classifier-blocked allow-rule auto-fix —
surfacing the exact line under needs-you and applying it only on the user's
explicit go, never routing around the denial.

## [2.8.2] — 2026-06-23

Recon search subagents run as `general-purpose` on `model: sonnet`, strictly
read-only — buying real understanding the haiku-locked Explore type can't.

## [2.8.1] — 2026-06-23

**Recon investigate-first by default.** Parallel read-only recon runs before
any goal that touches an existing system; "the description sounds clear" is the
failure mode it replaces. Skipped only for genuinely greenfield/one-liner wants.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-06-23

**factory-doctor + pg_safe_merge.** New factory-doctor skill: a one-pass
preflight/doctor for a repo + machine (software, gh auth + scopes, the merge
allow-rule, branch protection, CI, queue state) that auto-fixes everything
local. Pairs with `pg_safe_merge.py`, a verified-merge wrapper that re-checks
branch/body/base/CI/SHAs so the merge allow-rule stays narrow.

## [2.7.0] — 2026-06-23

**Real-run hardening** — validated against the first real 24-goal `merge: auto`
native run. Dispatch fills `min(wip, ready)` implementers
every iteration; transient infra deaths don't burn the respawn budget (which is
itself capped); the queue commit is always its own command; implementer-brief
traps closed (never `cd` to the main checkout, reproduce a bug before fixing,
stage only intended files); review loops converge.

## [2.6.1] — 2026-06-15

herdr-mode path / identity / dispatch fixes from a real run.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-06-15

**herdr execution mode (opt-in).** `config.execution: herdr` runs each
implementer as a fresh `claude` in an isolated `goal/<id>` herdr worktree pane —
parallel, observable, crash-recoverable. Default `native` keeps the in-process
path and full portability.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-06-12

**Permission-stall invariant.** A harness denial of the orchestrator's own
merge is an environment blocker, not a work failure: the goal holds its wip
slot, needs-you carries the exact allow-rule fix verbatim, and one notification
fires per distinct blocker set.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-06-12

`config.model` (inherit | sonnet | haiku) for spawned code agents, and goal
`type: bug | feature | chore` that shapes the contract — bugs lead with a
failing-test reproduction, features must bound scope, chores prove no behavior
change.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-06-12

Maintenance and documentation release.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-06-12

Maintenance and documentation release.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-12

Parallel-factory documentation: how multiple sessions safely work one queue.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-12

**Three-skill lineup + the docs/goals pipeline.** Retired the `wish` skill; the
`docs/goals/` file queue replaces GitHub issues as the work queue (no issue-body
size caps, no per-repo label bootstrap, versioned with the code).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-10

Added the **define-goal** skill (initially ported from `openai/skills`, then
adapted to Claude Code / Droid primitives).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-10

Replaced stale-model calibrations with outcome-based contracts in the (then
still present) `wish` skill.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-10

**Skills-only plugin.** Transformed `mcp-do` into a skills-only plugin
(named `pg-plugin` at the time; renamed `flywheel` in 3.0.0): removed the
stdio MCP server entirely.

## 0.x — 2026-04-13 → 2026-04-23 (mcp-do era)

Pre-history. A stdio MCP server wrapping the `droid` / `opencode` CLIs —
started as the `do` plugin, renamed to `mcp-do`, with the `pragmatic-growth`
marketplace created along the way. Removed in 1.0.0; preserved in git history.
