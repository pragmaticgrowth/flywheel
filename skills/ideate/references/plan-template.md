# The plan template (canonical — ideate step 5)

Write plans to `docs/goals/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (create the directory if
needed). Fill every section; sections marked *(code-shaped)* apply when the work
touches existing code and stay prose-light for greenfield. Keep the whole plan
under ~2 pages — a plan that needs more is usually two plans.

Two writing rules govern the entire document:

1. **Headers state the takeaway, not the topic and not the question.** A reader
   skimming only the headings must get the design's actual claims — that is what
   makes a wrong assumption catchable in seconds.
   - BAD (topic): `### Session storage`
   - BAD (question): `### How are sessions persisted?`
   - GOOD (takeaway): `### Sessions persist to Postgres before the daemon acks`
2. **Altitude: signatures and shapes, never function bodies.** If the plan starts
   containing implementations, it has dropped a level — that detail belongs to the
   implementer. Show a signature with its body elided (`{ ... }`), a file-tree
   diff, a call-flow sketch; never working code.

# <Plan title — a takeaway, not a label>

## What we're doing

<2–4 sentences in the owner's language. What will exist, for whom, and why now.>

## Current state

<What the user sees or experiences today — product behavior first, no file paths
in the opening lines. Then:>

Key discoveries:
- <finding with path:line>
- <pattern to follow with path:line>
- <constraint to work within>

## What will be true when done

- <observable outcome 1>
- <observable outcome 2>

## What we're NOT doing

<Mandatory, never empty — explicit exclusions prevent scope sprawl. Name the
tempting adjacent work and why it's excluded or deferred.>

## Design

<Takeaway-headed subsections. Where the work touches existing code, this section
is CODE-SHAPED, not prose:>

### <Takeaway: e.g. "recordsService.update accepts links, as create already does">

```<lang>
// exact signatures introduced or changed, bodies elided
async function update(args: UpdateArgs & { links?: Link[] }): Promise<Row> { ... }
```

### Files

```
created   src/x/y.ts        — <one line: what this file becomes responsible for>
modified  src/a/b.ts        — <one line>
```

### <Call-flow sketch — ONLY where control flow is non-obvious>

<entry → step → step, or a small mermaid flowchart>

## Open questions

<Every design fork the exploration raised. The agent may RECOMMEND an option; only
the owner resolves one. "Go with your recommendations" from the owner resolves ALL
open questions at once — record each as resolved with that provenance. A plan may
be handed to define-goal with questions still OPEN: an unresolved design question
is information, not a blocker, and a goal that trips over one has somewhere to
point. A resolved question keeps its one-line why forever.>

### OPEN — <the question, one line>
- Option A: <...>
- Option B: <...>
- Recommendation: <option + one-line why>

### RESOLVED <date> — <the question>
- <chosen option> — <one-line why> (<owner decision | owner: "go with your
  recommendations">)

## Phases

<Vertical slices, each independently verifiable end-to-end, each mapping 1:1 onto
one future goal. Slice test: if a phase cannot be verified without a LATER phase
existing, it is not a slice — re-cut. A decomposition ordered by layer ("all
schema, then all services, then all UI") is horizontal and produces nothing
testable until the last phase; cut through the layers instead — the thinnest
end-to-end path first, then widen.>

- [ ] Phase 1: <takeaway title — what a user/system can DO after this phase>
  - Files: <one line per file>
  - Verify: `<exact command>` · <plus any needs-independent-review item>
- [ ] Phase 2: <takeaway title>
  - Files: <...>
  - Verify: `<exact command>`
```

Checkbox lifecycle: ideate writes every phase `- [ ]`. Dispatch flips a phase to
`- [x]` in the same commit that settles its goal `completed`, and stamps the
frontmatter `status: done` when the last phase checks — a DISPLAY mirror only;
`index.yaml` remains the sole status authority, and dispatch's Phase 0 doctor
pass re-syncs a drifted checkbox in the plan-follows-index direction only.
